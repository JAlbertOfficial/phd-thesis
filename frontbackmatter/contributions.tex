%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This cumulative dissertation includes six chapters in which parts have been published as peer-reviewed research papers. In detail, Chapters 2, 4 and 5 are based on the respective accepted manuscripts, retaining their original formatting without any subsequent adjustments made. All research was conducted at the iES Landau, Institute for Environmental Sciences, at the University of Kaiserslautern--Landau (German: Rheinland--Pfälzische Technische Universität Kaiserslautern--Landau, also known as RPTU) in collaboration with the Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organization (KALRO) for field sampling activities in Kenya. Financial support was provided by the project "AflaZ: Zero Aflatoxin" funded by the Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture (BLE) under the reference AflaZ 2816PROC14. The subsequent section states the use of third party assistances and outlines the specific contributions made by both myself and the co-authors to the scientific work.

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this thesis, the AI tools ChatGPT (version 3.5) and DeepL (Translator) were utilized in the writing process. Throughout the entire writing process, DeepL was used for translation purposes. The use of ChatGPT was confined to the Introduction (Chapter 1), the Kenyan field study (Chapter 3), and synthesis (Chapter 6) and was not involved in Chapters that were published in peer-reviewed journals, i.e., Chapter 2, 4, and 5. Its practical applications included serving as a tool for improving the overall quality of the text. Specifically, ChatGPT was utilized for tasks such as providing suggestions for phrasing and sentence structure, finding synonyms, acting as a grammar and spell-checker, and aiding in the concise summarization of content. ChatGPT supported the programming and formatting of LaTeX for the preparation of the thesis draft, especially for table formatting and the generation of BibTeX entries for the bibliography.
